# HeadFlock

## Piece Description

An interactive art piece with flocking agents and camera interaction.

My idea was to have agents flocking about a screen and create a distortion in their movement as interpreted by a camera motion detector. Making my agents adhere to separation, alignment and cohesion rules was where I faced the most difficulty. I learned a lot about working with autonomous agents and handling vectors.

## Technology

- Motion detection with ml5.js
- Canvas created with ps5.js

## Reflection

I wanted way more agents on the canvas but with camera detection as well, it made the entire piece so slow. I wish there were more agents.
